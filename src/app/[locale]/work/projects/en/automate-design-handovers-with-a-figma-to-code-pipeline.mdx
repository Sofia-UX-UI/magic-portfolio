## Overview

In this project, we focused on automating the design handover process to bridge the gap between designers and developers. As the lead researcher, I guided the development of a chatbot that maps APIs directly to the design context, providing a unified source of truth. The goal was to reduce friction in the design handoff process and improve collaboration between the teams.

## Team

Sofia Orellano (Lead Product Designer / Researcher), Chengcheng Qu (Supervisor, Falmouth University), Luca Di Grazia (Supervisor, University of Lugano).

## Timeframe

6 months (2023-2024)

## Key Features

- **Persona-Informed Context**: I led the creation of a chatbot backend informed by a Persona, ensuring that the assistant’s responses were aligned with the design intent during handoffs.
- **Code Search Integration**: I integrated an AI-powered code search system to help both designers and developers find relevant API documentation and design constraints quickly.
- **Collaboration-Centric Tools**: My focus was on improving tool adoption across teams, providing UX-specific enhancements to existing code search systems for seamless collaboration.

## Research Approach

- **Mixed-Methods**: I conducted qualitative interviews with 9 UX designers, developers, and product managers, and surveyed 21 participants to gather insights into the pain points of the current handoff process.
- **Challenges Identified**: Through our research, we uncovered issues such as inconsistent adoption of code search tools, limited design-specific capabilities of AI, and communication bottlenecks between designers and developers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: I developed the chatbot backend in Python, which mapped design context to APIs.
- **Figma**: We integrated Figma to automate the extraction of design tokens and components, providing a seamless handoff between design and development.
- **ChatGPT Turbo**: Used to power the chatbot that mapped APIs directly to the design context, helping designers and developers access information more effectively.
- **PostCSS & Sass**: These tools were used to ensure design consistency in the frontend and streamline styling workflows.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge we faced was bridging the gap between design intent and technical implementation. Tools like GitHub Copilot were helpful but struggled to handle design-specific queries. Additionally, I noticed that many team members weren’t fully adopting the available tools, highlighting the need for more intuitive, context-aware solutions.

## Outcome

The automated chatbot has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have greater confidence that their design intent is accurately integrated into the development process, while developers can prioritize more complex tasks, knowing that the design context is mapped and accessible. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
