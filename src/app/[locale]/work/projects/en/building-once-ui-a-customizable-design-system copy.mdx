## Overview

In this project, we focused on automating the design handover process to bridge the gap between designers and developers. As the lead researcher, I guided the development of a chatbot that maps APIs directly to the design context, providing a unified source of truth. The goal was to reduce friction in the design handoff process and improve collaboration between the teams.
