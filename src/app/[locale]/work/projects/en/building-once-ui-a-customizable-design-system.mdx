## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using variables collection in Figma for design collaboration. Bioacoustics Learn is a generative educational platform designed to simplify the learning process for bioacousticians by helping them navigate complex acoustic data analysis tools. Developed as part of my MA in User Experience Design at Falmouth University, the platform combines generative AI and gamified elements, aiming to enhance users' technical skills and confidence, providing them with a seamless learning experience across devices.

## Team

- **My Role**: Lead Product Designer
- **Supervisor**: Jason Haritou. Design Leader. Tutor UX Design, MA User Experience Design, Falmouth University.

## Timeline

3 months (April to July 2024)

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using variables in Figma and styled-components, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using variables and Figma tokens.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.
- **User-Centered Design**: Developed a platform with structured learning paths and intuitive navigation to support both novice and experienced bioacousticians in their educational journey.
- **Gamified Learning**: Integrated progress tracking, achievement badges, interactive quizzes, and real-world challenges to motivate users and reinforce learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.
- **PostCSS & Sass**: For styling and ensuring accessibility and scalability.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Balancing Complexity and Simplicity**: The main challenge was designing a system that could accommodate the complexity of bioacoustic data while remaining intuitive for users of varying skill levels. This was overcome by creating easy-to-follow learning paths and providing clear guidance.
- **Skepticism from Users**: Bioacousticians are often cautious about adopting new tools. To address this, we built trust by validating the platform through user testing and gathering feedback to refine the design.

## Outcome

- The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
- **Engagement and Learning Retention**: Gamification features, such as progress tracking and achievement rewards, increased user retention by 40%, making the learning process more engaging.
- **Scalable Design System**: I created a comprehensive design system with over 700 components, ensuring accessibility, scalability, and consistency across devices and platforms.
- **Usability Improvements**: Through iterative design and user testing, the platform’s usability improved, leading to a 40% increase in task success rates and more efficient navigation.
