## Overview

In this project, we focused on automating the design handover process to bridge the gap between designers and developers. As the lead researcher, I guided the development of a chatbot that maps APIs directly to the design context, providing a unified source of truth. The goal was to reduce friction in the design handoff process and improve collaboration between the teams.

##Concept and Game Experience


Nomad’s Notes takes players on an adventure of cultural discovery and language learning. Players navigate diverse locales, interact with characters, and document their journeys in an interactive journal. Through immersive interactions and exploratory gameplay, users learn new languages while connecting with the essence of local cultures.


## Initial Research and Planning


Our process began with extensive market analysis and team collaboration to define project goals. Utilizing tools like Miro for brainstorming and Discord for cross-timezone communication, I helped establish our workflow and timelines. My responsibilities included:

Conducting user surveys and interviews to identify language-learning pain points.

Collaborating on a project charter to align objectives and milestones.


## User Research and Market Analysis


I led research efforts to analyze effective language-learning techniques and study gaps in current solutions. Surveys and interviews informed our focus on integrating gamification with cultural immersion. Key insights included:

- Users preferred interactive scenarios over rote memorization.

- Cultural context enhanced motivation and language retention.


## Information Architecture and Prototyping

To create intuitive navigation and interaction, I led the development of the game’s information architecture. Using Figma for prototyping, I designed:

- Menu systems and settings optimized for accessibility.

- Interactive journal features, aligning with user preferences for customization and review.

- User testing sessions provided iterative feedback, which refined these designs.


## Game Design and Localization

The gameplay features exploration and journaling modes. Players engage in:

- Exploring local environments, interacting with characters, and taking photos.

- Documenting their journey in the journal, decorating pages, and reviewing learned content.

- Localization efforts included partnering with native speakers to ensure accuracy and cultural relevance. For example, the initial module focused on Spanish learning in a fictionalized Valencia.


## User Testing and Validation


User testing validated core concepts, with a strong emphasis on immersive interactions. Feedback revealed:

85% satisfaction with gameplay mechanics.

Requests for enhanced grammar explanations and voiceover support for accessibility.


## Results and Industry Recognition

Our work received praise for merging cultural exploration with effective language education. Notable highlights:

Expert reviewers commended the journal feature for reinforcing learning.

Positive feedback encouraged plans for expanding language options and dynamic learning paths.


## Learnings and Next Steps

This project underscored the importance of aligning user needs with accessibility and design principles. Future iterations could include:

Broader language offerings and adaptive learning paths.

Enhanced accessibility features like text-to-speech and visual adjustments.

Expanding cultural content to enrich gameplay.
