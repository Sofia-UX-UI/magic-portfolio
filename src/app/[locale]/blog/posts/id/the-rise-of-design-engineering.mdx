summary: "In the post-Chat GPT era, Agile project planning has evolved to address the complexities of integrating AI into development processes. This shift highlights the importance of adaptability, as Agile methods must now accommodate AI model management, deployment, and collaboration between human and AI teams. Incremental development and feedback, as emphasized by Waldock (2015), remain essential, while soft skills like intuition and adaptability are becoming critical for curating and refining AI outputs effectively. As Agile adapts to diverse industries, success lies in balancing technical expertise with human-centered design and co-creation."

Agile practice has significantly impacted software development in the past decades, but the future of its application still seems uncertain. future of its application still seems uncertain. According to Beatriz Cabrero- Daniel (2023), the core challenges relate to “the integration of AI with Agile software development methodologies” and “are not limited to the software development process but also include AI model management, deployment, and monitoring”. .

Belinda Waldock (2015), in her book Being Agile in Business, emphasizes the significance of agile product execution through “incremental developments and getting feedback”. This approach resonates with me in terms of incorporating habits for better design practice, as I’ve recently experienced in previous exchanges with peers while preparing the rapid ideation sessions. The results achieved after incremental development surpassed the big-bang development approach, and they are easy to apply on an individual basis. Not to mention the impact on our confidence and mental health.

I have reservations about its relevance in a conventional working environment during the post-Chat GPT era, as project advancements now often entail collaborative endeavours between AI and human teams, in different speeds and contexts, raising “the need for specialized technical expertise” (Cabrero — Daniel 2023).

As Waldock (2015) develops further in her analysis, she highlights the importance of avoiding a rigid application of the methodology but adapting it to a specific project and team. Critical factors such as the project time constraints and the background of the team members, can definitely affect the success and efficiency of the adapted methodology. One of the main takeaways of her book is to develop your product in an agile way so that you will meet your audience all the way through. As an example, she mentioned Apple and the first iPhone, where the early adopters wanted to be part of its development and didn’t care about the bugs that I might have but on later editions and as it was massively produced, the product needed to become better.

When considering an envisioning process, it is important to capture the essence of a product and not to worry about the vagueness. Rubin (2013) mentions that can be “broken down into a few activities that output specific components: product vision, product backlog, product roadmap“. A challenge when trying to prioritize product backlog in AI Agile software development, according to Cabrero — Daniel (2023) might be “the unavailability of user stories and the difficulty of assessing their quality”. To address these challenges, “value-driven software processes can guide decision making and therefore, involve providers and customers early in the co-creation processes”.

According to Cabrero — Daniel (2023), “Context-and human-factors must also be considered” when focusing on implementing Agile methodology to AI projects. “For instance, for backlog prioritization, AI models need to be aligned with project goals; this is difficult for practitioners since projects can be from many different industries, from sports to financial.”

When I think about how can AI and human teams seamlessly flow together, I believe it relies more on soft skills of the designers such as intuition and the ability to understand how to curate AI creations and adapt them.
